    	<p> Even if you consider yourself "normal" when it comes to what you choose to eat, your relationship with food is likely more complicated than you realize. It might be the most complex relationship in your life, which explains why a poll of more than 6,000 Women's Health readers found that nearly 30 percent feel stressed about foodâ€”every...single...day. (Even more report food anxiety at least occasionally.)Sometimes that angst manifests in extreme ways: Approximately 5 percent of American women will be diagnosed with an eating disorder at some point in their lives, and 36 percent are obese. But even among those of us whose approach to food isn't physically unhealthy, you'd be hard-pressed to find an American woman who is totally free of food issues. For many, it's guilt about overeating or caving in to cravings for things we know aren't good for us. In other cases, it's more of a quirk, like avoiding foods with a certain texture or color, or shuddering if our vegetables and meat touch. For most of us, it's the fact that food is much more than the simple fuel our ancestors considered it to be. A piece of chocolate might be a sin, or a reward, or a comfort (or all three at different times). Is it any wonder that a balanced, unremorseful attitude toward food is practically extinct? So why do we love food one minute and hate it the next? Many reasons: physiology, genetics, and family and cultural baggage. But the relationship each of us has with the stuff we put into our mouths doesn't have to be such a roller-coaster ride. Once we have a clearer picture of what precisely shapes our eating behavior, we can enjoy our food a whole lot more.</p>
